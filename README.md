# SUPERNOVA
SUPERNOVA is a Processing sketch

SUPERNOVA exists in different formats. It is a website, Android application, distributed as a printout 
and is displayed in the gallery as a projection. It takes on a minimalist form, referencing 
Sol LeWitt’s Arcs, circle, and irregular bands, or perhaps Duchamp’s Rotary Demisphere (Precision Optics). 
Viewers can also access this site from their computer and are able to download a unique image by clicking 
on the page and simply pressing the “s” key on their keyboard. It is an attempt at proliferating art 
through various technological mediums while being historically grounded in both displays and aesthetics. 

The result is an immersive, sensorial experience randomly displaying different color combinations in the 
RGB color model in ten concentric circles. This characteristic of the piece is historically similar to 
Structuralist Film, as it runs frame by frame and is constructed out of a specific medium of the internet: color.
